                  <p style="text-align:center">I currently live in Bennington, Nebraska. In my free time I like to hang out with my friends,
                    play video games, spend time with my girlfriend, and do anything active. In the summer, my friends and I play sand volleyball
                    at Aksarben. In the winter my friends and I like to play pickleball indoors. I also enjoy going to the gym with my girlfriend.
                    I also enjoy spending time with my brother. He is always there when I am doing things with my friends.
